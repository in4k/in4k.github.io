<h1>Kickers of ELF</h1>
</center>
<p></p>
<p>
This distribution is a collection of programs that are generally
unrelated, except in that they all deal with ELF files.
</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these programs is to be illustrative and
educational -- to help fellow programmers understand ELF files and
something of how they work under the Linux platform.
</p>
<p>
Each program is independent. There is very little shared code between
them, and in fact they all take slightly different approaches to
handling ELF files.
</p>
<p>
The distribution includes:
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>sstrip</b>: a small utility that removes a few bytes from an
executable that strip leaves behind.
</li>
<li>
<b>objres</b>: a "compiler" for including arbitrary binary resources
in object files.
</li>
<li>
<b>elftoc</b>: a program that takes an ELF file and generates C code
that defines a struct with the same memory image, using the structs
and preprocessor symbols defined in &lt;elf.h&gt;.
</li>
<li>
<b>elfls</b>: a utility that displays an ELF file's program and/or
section header tables, which serve as a kind of global roadmap to the
file's contents.
</li>
<li>
<b>rebind</b>: a small utility that alters the binding of selected
symbols in an object file.
</li>
<li>
<b>ebfc</b>: a compiler for a tiny programming language. The compiler
can generate ELF executables, object files, and shared libraries.
</li>
<li>
<b>infect</b>: an example of how to modify an executable without
affecting its original program.
</li>
</ul>
