#### Errata

* `-march=haswell` should be **`-march=core2`**,
  the latter *usually, but not always,* generates smaller code
  ([source](https://github.com/faemiyah/dnload#compiler-flags))
* Ferris' "Squishy" packer isn't exactly '*general-purpose*'
  as compared to kkrunchy, but the approach is *more general* at least.
* runit and s6 are perfectly fine at supervising daemons.
* ryg/fr made kkrunchy, not kb/fr.

### PoroCYon (DistriNet LLVM meetup 2024, Ghent)

[slides (reveal.js)](https://pcy.be/tmp/priv/smol-pres/)


## Tools

### dynamic linkers

* ~~[elfling](https://github.com/google/elfling)~~ (currently broken)
* ~~[bold](http://www.alrj.org/pages/bold.html)~~ (currently broken)
* [dnload](https://github.com/faemiyah/dnload) (Linux, FreeBSD)
* [smol](https://github.com/PoroCYon/smol) (glibc Linux, with non-glibc
  "compatibility mode")
* cold by epoqe (not yet public)

### compressors

* shell dropping: `cp $$0 /tmp/M;(sed 1d $$0|lzcat)>$$_;exec $$_;`
* ~~[fishypack
  ](https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/cenotaph4soda/src/master/packer/?at=master):
  In-memory `memfd`/`execveat`-based decompressor~~ (Deprecated in favor of vondehi)
* [vondehi](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/vondehi): Next-generation in-memory
  `memfd`/`execveat`-based decompressor (See list of known bugs)
  * [autovndh](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1800243): script that bruteforces
    all possible gzip/lzma/xz/... options and automatically places a vondehi
    decompression stub at the beginning
* [oneKpaq](https://github.com/temisu/oneKpaq): Generic PAQ-based
  (de)compressor for 32-bit x86

### synths

* [ghostsyn](https://github.com/Juippi/ghostsyn)
* [4klang](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53398), [ForkedKlang
  ](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=11312). Note that the replayer code
  is 32-bit only! You'll need some hacks to make it work on 64-bit.
* [Clinkster](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61592), replayer is 32-bit
  only as well.
* [Oidos](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=69524), replayer is once more
  32-bit only.
* [Axiom](https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/) is "supposed" to work
* [WaveSabre](https://github.com/logicomacorp/WaveSabre) has included patches to have the replayer run on Linux

## Example code

### Basic GL stuff

* [liner (intro template)](https://github.com/shizmob/liner)
* [more GL init stuff](https://github.com/blackle/Linux-OpenGL-Examples/)
* [even smaller GL init if you only need a single fullscreen fragment shader,
   still works with default Ubuntu](https://github.com/blackle/Clutter-1k/)

### Basic synth setup

* [4klang](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/4klang-linux/tree/master/4klang)
* [Clinkster](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/4klang-linux/tree/master/clinkster)
* [Oidos](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/4klang-linux/tree/master/oidos)
* [V2](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/4klang-linux/tree/master/v2)
* TODO:
  * WaveSabre
  * Quiver?
  * 64klang2
  * the Brain Control one? ("Tunefish"?)
  * others
* Ghostsyn and Axiom should work by default (see [tools](/tools))

### Source code of a few intros

* [International Shipping by Suricrasia Online
  ](https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/international-shipping)
* [Ninjadev dabbles in intros](https://github.com/aleksanb/fourkay)
* [scaleMARK by Suricrasia Online](https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/scalemark)
* [작은 (small) by Limp Ninja & K2 & TiTAN](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/linux-4k-intro-template),
  should be quite usable as an intro template.
* [Enamel Pin by Suricrasia Online](https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/enamel-pin)
* [Nutrition Facts by Suricrasia Online](https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/nutrition-facts)

### Other stuff

* [Tetris clone, in 2k](https://github.com/donnerbrenn/Tetris2k)

## Explanations

### Some notes about the target platform

We'll mostly target the Revision compo rules, as it's the biggest party, and
they seem to be the most strict.

* ***The distro is always the latest Ubuntu***
* ***CODE WILL NOT BE RAN AS ROOT***
* These packages are installed by default: [18.10
  ](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.10/ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64.manifest),
  [19.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/19.04/ubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.manifest).
* Note that only the 64-bit versions of these libraries are installed. *If
  you're running a 32-bit binary, it **MUST** be static!*
* No SDL. Or maybe [not anymore?](lsc-wiki-las-sdl-revision)
* No GLFW, SFML, ..., GTK can be used to create a GL context

* [Syscalls](lsc-wiki-syscalls)
* [Creating small static binaries, ELF header
  hacks](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html) ([notes on doing the same, on ARM](lsc-wiki-tinyelf-arm))
* [Process creation](lsc-wiki-proc)
* [Dynamic linking](lsc-wiki-rtld)
* [C runtime](lsc-wiki-crt)

* [dnload](https://github.com/faemiyah/dnload/blob/master/README.rst):
  interesting read on all things sizecoding on mostly FreeBSD, but is
  applicable to Linux as well. Mostly correct and up-to-date, minus
  our smol hacks.
* [vondehi](lsc-wiki-vondehi)
* **smol**: see dynamic linking
